# How To Run

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (version 18 or above)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Step 1: Install Dependency

Next, navigate to the project directory then install development dependency by running:

```bash
npm install
```

## Step 5: Start the development server

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch your React application using Vite.

## Step 6: Build and deploy

When you're ready to build your React application for production, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized build of your application in the `build` directory.

To preview the production build locally, run the following command:

```bash
npm run preview
```
